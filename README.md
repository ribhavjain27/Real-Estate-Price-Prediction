# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
The objective is to perform data visualization to understand the insight of the data and predict the price using Linear Regression. 
  ### Dataset
     The results will be highly influenced by the data based on where did we find them, how it is formatted, is it consistent, if there are any outlier and so on.

### Various steps involved:
  
  ### Shaping the data:-
1. #### Visualizing Data:
         Plots the relation between price and various parameter.
2. #### Finding correlation Analysis and redundancies:
         Determine how parameters are related and removing the parameters that are not contributing. 
3. #### Removing outliers:
             Outliers can affect greatly the results of my learning algorithm. 
4. #### Standardization:
        The standardization is about feature scaling. It is useful to speed up the learning algorithm. The standardization rescales the features so that they will have the properties of the standard normal distribution with μ = 0 and σ = 1. So, I rescaled each of the variables by applying the following formula on every value:
                                            z = x − μ / σ
    ### Machine Learning:-
5. #### Sampling:
         Dividing the data in test and train set.
6. #### Learning Algorithm:
         In our case it is Linear Regression. The goal was to model a relationship between y, the dependent variable and x1,..., xp.

7. #### Predict Price:
         Using this model we can predict the price based on various parameters related to a particular house.
